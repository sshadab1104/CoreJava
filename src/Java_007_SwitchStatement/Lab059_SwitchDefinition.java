    // What is Switch Statement?
    // A switch statement in Java is a control-flow structure used to execute one
    // out of many possible code blocks based on the value of an expression.
    // It is used when you need to compare a single variable with multiple constant values.
    // Switch makes the code readable, organized, and faster than long if-else chains.
    //
    // Important Points
    // switch works with:
    //✔ int
    //✔ byte
    //✔ short
    //✔ char
    //✔ String
    //✔ enum
    //
    //break stops the execution; without it → falls through to next case.
    //
    //default runs only when no cases match..\
